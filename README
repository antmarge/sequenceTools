This mainly contains a program to call genotypes from low coverage sequence data using the "random draw" method (see Haak et al. 2015, Nature). To install, download stack (https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install<Paste>) and run "stack install". If you don't have the Haskell compiler installed, it will tell you to run "stack setup". Please do so. The stack installations won't interfere with a system-wide installation. If everything goes as planned, you should end up having the executables defined in this package under ~/.local/bin.
