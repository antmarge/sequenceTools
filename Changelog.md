V 1.2.3 : Adapted to newest sequence-formats. Had to change all the chromosome-related code to the newType Chrom datatype. Also started implementing normaliseBimWithVCF.

V 1.2.4: normaliseBimWithVCF is ready.

V 1.3.0: Lots of refactoring. Lots of testing. PileupCaller is ready again, all other tools are deactivated for now.
